Happy Mother's
Day MOM !!!
-
You Always
Inspire Me
To Do My Best
-
You Taught
Me That I Can 
Do Anything
-
We Are In A
Remarkable Time
-
A Lot Of People
Are Not Doing Well
-
But I Am Doing Fine
Because You
Sparked My Love
-
For Code
& Problem
Solving
-
I Love You So
So Much
-
Always Remember
-
YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING YOU
SET YOUR MIND
TO
-
I Love You
